# 🏗️ Architecture

Orchestrix Veritas follows a modular Agentic RAG architecture inspired by production AI systems.

Each responsibility is isolated into a dedicated component, making the system easier to maintain, extend, and test.

The workflow is orchestrated through a LangGraph-style state machine where every stage updates a shared workflow state before handing control to the next agent.

This design enables:

* Modular development
* Independent testing of each agent
* Retry and recovery mechanisms
* Easier debugging
* Production-oriented scalability

## Workflow Overview

The complete Agentic RAG workflow consists of multiple independent agents that communicate through a shared workflow state.

### Step 1 — Guardrails

* Validate the incoming user query.
* Block unsafe or unsupported requests.
* Prevent invalid workflow execution.

### Step 2 — Document Detection

* Detect document type automatically.
* Route files to the correct parser.
* Support PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV, XLSX, TXT, and images.

### Step 3 — Parsing

* Extract text from the uploaded documents.
* Preserve formatting whenever possible.
* Normalize content into a common structure.

### Step 4 — Metadata Extraction

* Generate metadata such as:

  * document name
  * page number
  * section title
  * headings
  * chunk identifiers

### Step 5 — Chunking

* Split documents into meaningful chunks.
* Preserve semantic boundaries.
* Maintain chunk overlap for retrieval quality.

### Step 6 — Embedding Generation

* Convert text chunks into dense vector embeddings.
* Use SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
* Produce 384-dimensional embeddings.

### Step 7 — Vector Storage

* Store embeddings inside Qdrant.
* Associate vectors with metadata for retrieval.

### Step 8 — Hybrid Retrieval

The retrieval pipeline combines multiple retrieval techniques:

* Dense semantic retrieval
* BM25 keyword retrieval
* Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

This provides significantly better recall than using semantic search alone.

### Step 9 — Context Evaluation

* Evaluate whether sufficient context was retrieved.
* Trigger retries when confidence is low.

### Step 10 — Answer Generation

* Build prompts using retrieved context.
* Generate grounded answers with Ollama.
* Fall back to retrieved context if the LLM is unavailable.

### Step 11 — Verification

* Verify that generated answers are supported by retrieved evidence.
* Check citations.
* Validate confidence scores.

### Step 12 — Hallucination Detection

Detect potential hallucinations using:

* confidence thresholds
* citation validation
* context availability
* answer grounding

### Step 13 — Confidence Retry

When confidence falls below the configured threshold:

* rewrite the query
* perform retrieval again
* regenerate the answer
* repeat until the retry limit is reached

### Step 14 — Safe Response

Only verified and grounded answers are returned to the user.

Otherwise, the workflow produces a safe fallback response indicating insufficient evidence.

# 🧠 Agent Responsibilities

Orchestrix Veritas is built using a modular agent-based architecture. Each agent performs a single responsibility and communicates through a shared `RAGState`, making the workflow maintainable, extensible, and production-friendly.

| Agent                        | Responsibility                                                                           | Input               | Output                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Guardrail Agent**          | Validates incoming user queries and blocks unsafe requests.                              | User query          | Validated query / rejection |
| **Document Detection Agent** | Detects document type before parsing.                                                    | Uploaded file       | Document type               |
| **Parser Agent**             | Extracts text from supported document formats.                                           | File                | Raw extracted text          |
| **Metadata Agent**           | Generates metadata such as page number, section titles, headings, and chunk identifiers. | Parsed document     | Metadata-enriched document  |
| **Chunking Agent**           | Splits documents into semantically meaningful chunks.                                    | Parsed text         | Document chunks             |
| **Embedding Agent**          | Converts chunks into dense vector embeddings.                                            | Chunks              | Vector embeddings           |
| **Retrieval Agent**          | Retrieves relevant chunks using Hybrid Retrieval (Dense + BM25 + RRF).                   | User query          | Ranked document chunks      |
| **Context Evaluator Agent**  | Determines whether retrieved context is sufficient for answer generation.                | Retrieved chunks    | Context quality score       |
| **Query Rewrite Agent**      | Rewrites ambiguous or low-confidence queries for improved retrieval.                     | Original query      | Optimized query             |
| **Retrieval Router Agent**   | Routes retrieval requests through the appropriate retrieval strategy.                    | Query               | Retrieval execution         |
| **Answer Generator Agent**   | Generates grounded responses using Ollama or a fallback strategy.                        | Retrieved context   | Generated answer            |
| **Verification Agent**       | Verifies that the generated answer is supported by retrieved evidence.                   | Answer + context    | Verification result         |
| **Answer Verifier**          | Validates citations, confidence, and answer completeness.                                | Generated answer    | Validation report           |
| **Hallucination Checker**    | Detects unsupported or hallucinated responses.                                           | Answer + evidence   | Hallucination assessment    |
| **Confidence Retry Agent**   | Automatically retries retrieval and generation when confidence is low.                   | Verification result | Improved response           |
| **RAG Guardrails**           | Applies final quality and safety checks before returning the response.                   | Verified answer     | Safe response               |
| **Safe Response Formatter**  | Formats the final API/CLI response into a clean structure.                               | Final answer        | User response               |

---

## Shared Workflow State

All agents communicate through a shared **`RAGState`** object.

The workflow state contains information such as:

* User query
* Uploaded file paths
* Parsed documents
* Metadata
* Chunked text
* Retrieved chunks
* Generated answer
* Citations
* Sources
* Confidence score
* Verification results
* Guardrail warnings
* Retry count
* Workflow events

Using a shared state object allows every agent to contribute information without tightly coupling components together, following a LangGraph-inspired architecture.

# 🔍 Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline

Orchestrix Veritas uses a **Hybrid Retrieval** architecture that combines semantic search with traditional keyword search to maximize retrieval accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

Unlike basic RAG systems that rely only on vector similarity, this project fuses multiple retrieval strategies before generating an answer.

---

## Retrieval Architecture

F[Top Context]

G[Answer Generator]

A --> B
A --> C

```
---

## Dense Semantic Retrieval

Semantic retrieval converts the user query into an embedding and searches the vector database for conceptually similar chunks.

### Advantages

* Understands meaning instead of exact wording
* Handles synonyms
* Supports natural language questions
* Finds relevant context even when wording differs

Example:

**Document**

```text
The organization reported increased quarterly earnings.
```

**User Query**

```text
How much did company profits grow?
```

Even though the word **profits** does not appear, semantic retrieval still finds the correct document because the embedding captures contextual meaning.

---

## BM25 Keyword Retrieval

BM25 is a statistical ranking algorithm that scores documents based on keyword frequency and rarity.

Unlike embeddings, BM25 performs exact keyword matching.

### Advantages

* Excellent for identifiers
* Product names
* Policy numbers
* Regulatory clauses
* Financial terminology
* Acronyms

Example:

```text
SEC Rule 17a-4
```

Semantic retrieval may not rank this highly, while BM25 immediately identifies the exact document.

---

## Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Instead of choosing between semantic retrieval and keyword retrieval, Orchestrix Veritas combines both ranking lists using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**.

RRF assigns higher scores to chunks that consistently rank well across multiple retrieval methods.

### Why use RRF?

* Better recall
* Better ranking stability
* Reduces missed documents
* Improves answer quality

Rather than depending on a single retrieval strategy, RRF leverages the strengths of both.

---

## Reranking

After retrieval, the candidate chunks are reranked using their relevance to the user query.

Instead of returning the first retrieved chunk, the system selects the most relevant evidence before answer generation.

Benefits include:

* Improved precision
* Better context quality
* Reduced irrelevant chunks
* Lower hallucination risk

---

## Retrieval Configuration

| Parameter              |            Value |
| ---------------------- | ---------------: |
| Vector Database        |           Qdrant |
| Embedding Model        | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 |
| Embedding Dimension    |              384 |
| Dense Top-K            |               15 |
| BM25 Top-K             |               15 |
| RRF Top-K              |               10 |
| Final Reranked Results |                5 |

---

## Why Hybrid Retrieval?

A purely semantic search system can miss exact identifiers.

A purely keyword-based system struggles with natural language.

Hybrid Retrieval combines both approaches to provide:

* Higher recall
* Better precision
* Improved grounding
* Stronger evidence selection
* Lower hallucination rates
* More reliable answers for financial and regulatory documents


# 🛡️ Guardrails & Safety

Orchestrix Veritas incorporates multiple layers of validation and safety checks throughout the retrieval and generation pipeline.

Rather than relying solely on an LLM, the system evaluates the quality of both the input query and the generated response before returning results to the user.

---

## Query Guardrails

Before executing the retrieval workflow, every incoming query passes through the **Guardrail Agent**.

The Guardrail Agent performs:

* Query validation
* Empty query detection
* Unsupported request detection
* Basic safety filtering
* Workflow initialization checks

If a query fails validation, the workflow terminates gracefully with an appropriate response instead of continuing through unnecessary retrieval steps.

---

## Response Guardrails

After answer generation, the response passes through an additional layer of validation.

The response is checked for:

* Missing evidence
* Missing citations
* Empty responses
* Unsupported claims
* Low-confidence answers

Only responses that satisfy the configured quality criteria are returned to the user.

---

## Safe Response Formatting

The final response is formatted using the **Safe Response Formatter**, which produces a consistent response structure containing:

* Answer
* Confidence score
* Sources
* Citations
* Verification status
* Workflow events
* Guardrail warnings

This makes the API predictable and easier to integrate into downstream applications.

---

# ✅ Verification & Hallucination Detection

Producing an answer is not sufficient.

Every generated response is evaluated to determine whether it is actually supported by retrieved evidence.

---

## Verification Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR

A[Generated Answer]

B[Verification Agent]

C[Citation Validation]

D[Grounding Check]

E[Confidence Evaluation]

F[Hallucination Checker]

G[Safe Response]

A --> B
B --> C
C --> D
D --> E
E --> F
F --> G
```

---

## Verification Agent

The Verification Agent evaluates whether:

* An answer exists
* Supporting context exists
* Citations are available
* Confidence exceeds the configured threshold
* The response is grounded in retrieved evidence

The verification result becomes part of the shared workflow state and is available to downstream components.

---

## Hallucination Detection

The Hallucination Checker analyzes generated responses for signs of unsupported content.

Signals include:

* Missing retrieved context
* Missing citations
* Low confidence
* Unsupported statements
* Empty evidence

If hallucination risk is detected, the workflow can:

* Trigger query rewriting
* Retry retrieval
* Regenerate the answer
* Return a safe fallback response

instead of presenting unsupported information to the user.

---

## Confidence-Based Retry

When verification determines that confidence falls below the configured threshold:

1. The original query is rewritten.
2. Retrieval is executed again.
3. New context is evaluated.
4. A new answer is generated.
5. Verification is repeated.

This retry mechanism increases the likelihood of producing grounded, evidence-backed responses while reducing hallucinations.

---

## Why This Matters

Many traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems generate responses immediately after retrieval.

Orchestrix Veritas introduces additional validation layers to ensure that responses are:

* Grounded
* Explainable
* Verifiable
* Supported by retrieved evidence
* Safer for enterprise document intelligence applications

These verification and guardrail mechanisms help improve response reliability while reducing the risk of hallucinated or unsupported answers.
